      <h3>Future</h3>
      <p>To continue to support London’s global competitiveness, the West End must accommodate growth in space for people in its buildings and in its public realm. The opening of the Elizabeth Line is predicted to rise by an additional 81 million visits annually by 2031, The new department store, Flannel, which will be opening in June 2019, aimed to be the next biggest global luxury retailer. These new constructions along with well planned, well delivered and well-funded management of the district will help the Oxford street to retain its world beating position.</p>
